Here’s a **practical, disciplined way to run listening tests** so you can infer _structure_ from sound—not just preference. This is how reverb designers actually learn other reverbs.

---

## 1) Split listening into **questions**, not presets

Don’t audition presets as “sounds.”  
Audition them as **answers to specific questions**.

Each pass should ask _one_ question only.

### Core questions to rotate through

- **Transient handling:** does the attack stay sharp or smear?
    
- **Early geometry:** can I localise walls / size quickly?
    
- **Density build:** how fast does it turn from echoes → wash?
    
- **Diffusion quality:** smooth vs metallic vs phasey?
    
- **Decay shape:** straight line, bloom, choke, or multi-slope?
    
- **Spectral decay:** do highs die faster? when?
    
- **Motion:** static, slow drift, chorus, swirl?
    
- **Stability:** does it collapse under sustained tones?
    

Never try to answer all at once.

---

## 2) Use a fixed, minimal test signal set

Use **the same 6–8 signals every time**. No exceptions.

### Mandatory test signals

1. **Impulse / hand clap**
    
    - Reveals ER timing, density ramp, diffusion
        
2. **Dry snare**
    
    - Transient smear, early/late separation
        
3. **Muted pluck (guitar / kalimba)**
    
    - Modal behaviour, metallic ringing
        
4. **Sustained sine sweep or organ chord**
    
    - Modes, chorusing, pitch instability
        
5. **Noise burst (10–50 ms)**
    
    - Density vs diffusion, decay smoothness
        
6. **Dry vocal phrase**
    
    - Geometry + intelligibility
        
7. _(Optional)_ **Rhythmic loop**
    
    - Temporal stability, modulation artifacts
        

Don’t change sources mid-study.

---

## 3) Lock the macro controls first

For each reverb:

- Pick **one Size**
    
- One **Decay**
    
- One **Wet level**
    
- Turn off extras (EQ, ducking, shimmer, modulation if possible)
    

You want to hear the **core engine**, not the polish.

Only after this do you explore modulation, diffusion, character knobs.

---

## 4) A/B by **one control at a time**

When exploring presets or parameters:

- Move **one knob**
    
- Return it
    
- Move the next
    

Listen for _what changed_, not _what sounds better_.

Ask:

> “Did this change geometry, structure, density, diffusion, or colour?”

If you can’t name it, you didn’t learn anything.

---

## 5) Use time-based listening (very important)

Loop a **single transient**, then listen at fixed times:

- **0–20 ms** → geometry
    
- **20–80 ms** → ER → late transition
    
- **80–300 ms** → diffusion ramp
    
- **300 ms+** → structure, decay, modulation
    

Many reverbs sound similar overall but **very different at specific times**.

---

## 6) Preset taxonomy: reverse-engineer intent

As you browse presets, classify them mentally:

- Is this preset mainly changing:
    
    - ER geometry?
        
    - diffusion speed?
        
    - damping curve?
        
    - modulation depth?
        
    - coupling?
        

Ignore names. Look for **families**:

- “Room X” presets usually differ by ER timing + damping
    
- “Hall Y” presets often share ER but change late diffusion + modulation
    
- “Plate” presets usually have dispersion + fast diffusion
    
- “Bloom / Ambient” presets often delay diffusion + decay ramp
    

This tells you how the designer thinks.

## 7) Specific reverbs worth studying (for _structure_, not taste)

Study _why_ they behave differently.

- **Lexicon style algorithms**
    
    - Slow diffusion ramp, modulation-heavy tails
        
    - Great for studying bloom and spin
        
- **EMT Plate emulations**
    
    - Dispersion vs diffusion balance
        
    - How plates smear transients immediately
        
- **TC Electronic VSS / System-style halls**
    
    - Clear ER geometry + clean late field
        
    - Study geometry preservation
        
- **Valhalla DSP**
    
    - Excellent examples of single-idea algorithms
        
    - Easy to hear diffusion vs modulation vs damping tradeoffs
        

(You don’t need many—**deep study beats breadth**.)

---

## 8) Compare _algorithmic approaches_, not brands

When listening, label the reverb internally as:

- ER-heavy + light late
    
- Fast diffusion FDN
    
- Dispersion-heavy (plate/spring)
    
- Modulation-driven smoothing
    
- Geometry-first → structure-late
    

Try to guess:

> “If I had to rebuild this, what blocks would I use?”

If you can’t answer that, listen again.

---

## 9) Take notes in a fixed template

Use the same headings every time:

```
Reverb:
Preset:
Signal:
Size / Decay:

Early geometry:
Density ramp:
Diffusion quality:
Dispersion present? (Y/N)
Modulation type:
Decay shape:
Spectral decay:
Stability issues:
Overall design guess:
```

Patterns will emerge fast.

## 10) Two crucial mindset tips

### Don’t judge “good vs bad”

Some of the _most educational_ reverbs sound awful on music.

### Don’t copy sounds—copy **relationships**

You’re learning:

- what increases diffusion _without_ killing transients
    
- what causes metallic ringing
    
- what makes tails bloom
    
- what keeps vocals intelligible
    

That knowledge transfers directly into your tuning.

## One-sentence takeaway

> **The goal of listening tests isn’t to like a reverb—it’s to identify which perceptual dimensions it prioritises (geometry, diffusion, density, structure) and infer the blocks and control relationships that must exist to produce that behaviour.**

When you’re ready, the **second phase (signal analysis)** becomes vastly more meaningful because you’ll already know _what you’re looking for_.
