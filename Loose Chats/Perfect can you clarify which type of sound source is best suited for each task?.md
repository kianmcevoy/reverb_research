Here’s a **clear mapping of listening tasks → best sound sources**, with *why* each one works. This lets you choose the **right source for the question**, not just “a good sound”.

## Core rule

> **Different sources excite different parts of a reverb.**
> If the source doesn’t excite the mechanism you’re testing, you won’t hear it.

# Sound source → what it’s best for

## 1) **Impulse / Hand clap**

**Best for**

* Early reflections (timing, geometry)
* Predelay audibility
* Density ramp (echo → wash)
* Diffusion problems (metallic ringing)

**Why**

* Broadband
* Instantaneous
* Reveals time structure brutally

**Use for**

* ER structure
* Diffusion speed
* Early vs late handoff

**Avoid for**

* Modulation character
* Tonal decay

---

## 2) **Dry snare / rimshot**

**Best for**

* Transient preservation vs smear
* Perceived size
* Attack → tail separation
* ER masking problems

**Why**

* Strong transient + short body
* Real musical context

**Use for**

* Rooms, halls
* Predelay tuning
* Geometry clarity

**Avoid for**

* Fine dispersion analysis

---

## 3) **Noise burst (10–50 ms)**

**Best for**

* Density vs diffusion distinction
* Grain vs smoothness
* Decay shape (straight vs bloom)

**Why**

* Broadband
* Removes pitch masking
* Lets you hear “texture” only

**Use for**

* FDN qualityUntitled
* Diffusion effectiveness
* Bloom tuning

**Avoid for**

* Geometry (no direction)

---

## 4) **Muted pluck (guitar, kalimba, pizz string)**

**Best for**

* Modes
* Metallic ringing
* Dispersion audibility
* Physicality

**Why**

* Rich spectrum + short attack
* Excites resonances cleanly

**Use for**

* Spring / plate analysis
* Detecting dispersion allpasses
* Identifying resonant structure

**Avoid for**

* ER geometry

---

## 5) **Sustained sine / organ chord**

**Best for**

* Modulation audibility
* Pitch stability
* Chorus / swirl detection
* Eigenmode behaviour

**Why**

* Stable input
* Any movement is from the reverb

**Use for**

* Modulation depth/rate
* Matrix “spin”
* Stability tests

**Avoid for**

* ER timing

---

## 6) **Slow sine sweep**

**Best for**

* Frequency-dependent decay (damping)
* Resonance hotspots
* Spectral unevenness

**Why**

* Scans the system
* Reveals decay vs frequency

**Use for**

* LF vs HF RT60
* Modal clustering
* Damping curve inference

**Avoid for**

* Transient behaviour

Untitled
## 7) **Dry spoken vocal**

**Best for**

* Intelligibility
* Geometry vs structure balance
* Early masking
* Real-world usability

**Why**

* Familiar reference
* Wide dynamics
* Sensitive to smearing

**Use for**

* Rooms, halls
* Predelay / ER balance
* Late-tail clarity

**Avoid for**

* Subtle diffusion analysis

---

## 8) **Pad / sustained texture**

**Best for**

* Bloom
* Long-tail motion
* Late diffusion stability

**Why**

* Constant energy feedUntitled
* Lets tail evolve

**Use for**

* Cathedral / Bloom presets
* Late modulation
* Density ceiling

**Avoid for**

* ER detail

---

## 9) **Rhythmic loop**

**Best for**

* Temporal stability
* Groove interaction
* Pumping / modulation artifacts

**Why**

* Repetition reveals instability
* Easy A/B comparison

**Use for**

* Modulation sanity checks
* Time coherence

**Avoid for**

* Structural inference

| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| ER geometry         | Impulse / clap     |

| Density ramp        | Noise burst        |
| Diffusion quality   | Noise burst        |
| Dispersion          | Muted pluck        |
| Modes               | Muted pluck / sine |
| Modulation          | Sustained sine     |
| Spin / swirl        | Organ chord        |
| Damping curve       | Sine sweep         |
| Transient smear     | Snare              |
| Intelligibility     | Vocal              |
| Bloom               | Pad                |

## How to use this efficiently

* **Never change source mid-question**
* Run the same source across multiple reverbs/presets
* Write answers *before* judging “good/bad”
* If you can’t hear the effect → wrong source

---

## One-sentence takeaway

> **Use impulses to hear time, plucks to hear structure, noise to hear texture, sines to hear motion, and vocals to hear truth.**

When you’re ready, the **signal-analysis phase** becomes much easier because you’ll already know *what behaviour you’re trying to confirm*.
