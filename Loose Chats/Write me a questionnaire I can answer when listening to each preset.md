Here’s a **compact, repeatable listening questionnaire** designed to force clear observations and help you infer structure. Print it, duplicate it, don’t edit it per reverb.

# Reverb Listening Questionnaire

**Reverb / Plugin:**  
**Preset name:**  
**Signal used:**  
**Size / Decay / Mix (fixed):**

---

## 1) First impression (10 seconds, no tweaking)

- What does it _feel_ like immediately?  
    ☐ tight ☐ open ☐ metallic ☐ smooth ☐ diffuse ☐ resonant ☐ blurry ☐ clear
    
- One-word character:
    

---

## 2) Transients

(Use clap / snare)

- Attack clarity:  
    ☐ very sharp ☐ mostly intact ☐ softened ☐ smeared ☐ dissolved
    
- Does the reverb grab the transient immediately?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Is there audible predelay?  
    ☐ none ☐ short ☐ obvious
    
- Does the transient “detach” from the tail cleanly?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    

---

## 3) Early reflections / geometry

(Listen 0–80 ms)

- Can you hear discrete early reflections?  
    ☐ clear ☐ vague ☐ none
    
- Do they feel directional / spatially informative?  
    ☐ yes ☐ somewhat ☐ no
    
- Apparent space size from ER alone:  
    ☐ very small ☐ room ☐ hall ☐ huge ☐ unclear
    

---

## 4) Density build

(Listen 20–300 ms)

- Density ramp speed:  
    ☐ very fast ☐ fast ☐ medium ☐ slow
    
- Does it go from echoes → wash smoothly?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Any flutter or grain before it smooths out?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    

---

## 5) Diffusion quality

(Listen for ringing / repetition)

- Metallic or ringing artefacts?  
    ☐ none ☐ slight ☐ obvious
    
- Can you hear repeating patterns?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Overall diffusion feels:  
    ☐ weak ☐ moderate ☐ strong ☐ extreme
    

---

## 6) Dispersion / material character

(Use pluck / noise burst)

- Does the attack smear by frequency?  
    ☐ no ☐ subtle ☐ strong
    
- Any “boing / zing / shimmer”?  
    ☐ no ☐ slight ☐ strong
    
- Feels more like:  
    ☐ air ☐ surface ☐ metal ☐ spring ☐ object
    

---

## 7) Decay & damping

(Listen long tail)

- Decay shape:  
    ☐ straight ☐ bloom ☐ multi-stage ☐ choke
    
- High frequencies die faster than lows?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Tail brightness over time:  
    ☐ stable ☐ darkens ☐ brightens ☐ wobbles
    

---

## 8) Modulation / motion

(Use sustained tone)

- Is there motion in the tail?  
    ☐ none ☐ subtle ☐ obvious ☐ strong
    
- Motion character:  
    ☐ smooth ☐ chorusy ☐ random ☐ swirling ☐ unstable
    
- Does pitch feel stable?  
    ☐ yes ☐ slightly ☐ no
    

---

## 9) Stability & realism

- Does the reverb collapse on sustained input?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Does it feel like a _space_ or an _effect_?  
    ☐ space ☐ effect ☐ ambiguous
    
- Realism vs character:  
    ☐ realistic ☐ balanced ☐ stylised
    

---

## 10) Structural inference (important)

Answer instinctively.

- Dominant design feels like:  
    ☐ ER-driven  
    ☐ fast-diffusion FDN  
    ☐ dispersion-heavy (plate/spring)  
    ☐ modulation-driven  
    ☐ hybrid
    
- Geometry vs structure balance:  
    ☐ geometry-heavy ☐ balanced ☐ structure-heavy
    
- If rebuilding this, which blocks are essential?  
    ☐ strong ER  
    ☐ scattering  
    ☐ allpass dispersion  
    ☐ heavy modulation  
    ☐ orthogonal matrix  
    ☐ something else: __________
    

---

## 11) Preset intent (guess)

- Intended use:  
    ☐ room ☐ plate ☐ hall ☐ cathedral ☐ ambient/bloom ☐ special effect
    
- Works best on:  
    ☐ drums ☐ vocals ☐ pads ☐ sound design ☐ everything ☐ nothing

## 12) One-sentence takeaway

> “This reverb mainly prioritises ___________________ over ___________________.”

### How to use this properly

- Don’t skip questions.
    
- Don’t tweak mid-pass.
    
- Compare **answers across presets**, not just impressions.
    
- Patterns matter more than single results.
    

If you want next, I can:

- compress this into a **one-page scoring sheet**,
    
- adapt it specifically for **spring / plate / hall** study,
    
- or help you build a **listening → hypothesis → test loop** for phase 2 (signal analysis).
