## Reverb Listening Sheet

**Manufacturer / Plugin:**  
**Preset name:**  
**Category (if named):**  
**Dry/Wet fixed at:**  
**Size / Decay fixed at:**

---

### 1. First impression (no analysis yet)

- Immediate character (circle):  
    tight / open / smooth / metallic / diffuse / resonant / cloudy / clear
    
- One sentence description:
    

---

### 2. Transients & predelay

_(Use snare or clap)_

- Attack preserved?  
    ☐ fully ☐ mostly ☐ softened ☐ smeared
    
- Audible predelay?  
    ☐ none ☐ short ☐ obvious
    
- Does reverb grab the transient immediately?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    

---

### 3. Early reflections / geometry

_(Listen 0–80 ms)_

- Discrete early reflections audible?  
    ☐ clear ☐ vague ☐ none
    
- Directional / spatial information present?  
    ☐ yes ☐ somewhat ☐ no
    
- Apparent size from ER alone:  
    ☐ very small ☐ room ☐ hall ☐ huge ☐ unclear
    

---

### 4. Density & diffusion

_(Noise burst)_

- Density build speed:  
    ☐ very fast ☐ fast ☐ medium ☐ slow
    
- Any grain / flutter before smoothing?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Tail smoothness:  
    ☐ metallic ☐ slightly rough ☐ smooth ☐ extremely smooth
    

---

### 5. Dispersion / material character

_(Muted pluck)_

- Frequency-dependent smear audible?  
    ☐ none ☐ subtle ☐ strong
    
- “Boing / shimmer / zing”?  
    ☐ no ☐ slight ☐ strong
    
- Feels more like:  
    ☐ air ☐ surface ☐ metal ☐ spring ☐ object
    

---

### 6. Decay & damping

_(Noise burst or pad)_

- Decay shape:  
    ☐ straight ☐ bloom ☐ multi-stage ☐ choked
    
- High frequencies decay faster than lows?  
    ☐ yes ☐ no
    
- Tail colour over time:  
    ☐ stable ☐ darkening ☐ brightening ☐ unstable
    

---

### 7. Modulation & motion

_(Sustained sine / organ)_

- Motion present?  
    ☐ none ☐ subtle ☐ obvious ☐ strong
    
- Motion character:  
    ☐ smooth ☐ chorusy ☐ random ☐ swirling
    
- Pitch stability:  
    ☐ stable ☐ slightly unstable ☐ unstable
    

---

### 8. Structure vs geometry judgement

- Early sound dominated by:  
    ☐ geometry ☐ neither ☐ structure
    
- Late tail dominated by:  
    ☐ geometry ☐ neither ☐ structure
    
- Overall feels more like:  
    ☐ space ☐ object ☐ field
    

---

### 9. Structural inference (important)

Based on listening alone, this preset likely uses:

- ☐ strong ER model
    
- ☐ scattering
    
- ☐ fast diffusion matrix
    
- ☐ dispersion allpasses
    
- ☐ heavy modulation
    
- ☐ resonant coupling
    

Primary design emphasis (circle one):  
**geometry / diffusion / dispersion / structure / modulation**

## How this fits into your workflow

1. **Listening pass**  
    – fill out questionnaire  
    – write hypotheses
    
2. **Analysis pass**  
    – run only the plots relevant to your hypotheses  
    – confirm or reject
    
3. **Cross-compare**  
    – same preset type across manufacturers  
    – look for common structures vs signature differences
