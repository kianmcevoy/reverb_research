 **A consolidated analysis table**  
    – what element you’re trying to understand  
    – what to listen with  
    – what analysis best reveals it


|Element to identify|What you’re listening for (perceptual cue)|Best listening source|Why this source|Best analysis method|What the analysis shows|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Early geometry**|Discrete reflections, sense of size/direction|Hand clap / impulse|Broadband, transient, exposes timing|Linear-time IR|ER timing, spacing, directionality|
|**Predelay**|Separation between dry attack and tail|Snare / vocal|Clear attack with context|IR + waveform|Gap before ER onset|
|**Transient handling**|Attack preserved vs smeared|Snare / rimshot|Sharp transient + body|IR (early window)|Early diffusion strength|
|**Density ramp**|Echoes → wash over time|Noise burst (10–50 ms)|Removes pitch masking|IR (log time)|Rate of density increase|
|**Diffusion quality**|Metallic vs smooth tail|Noise burst|Reveals correlation|Autocorrelation / echo density|Decorrelation rate|
|**Dispersion**|Frequency-dependent smearing (“boing”, shimmer)|Muted pluck|Excites wide spectrum briefly|Spectrogram / waterfall|Time–frequency bending|
|**Damping (spectral decay)**|Highs dying faster than lows|Noise burst / sweep|Broadband energy|Banded RT60 / EDC|RT60 vs frequency|
|**Decay shape**|Straight, bloom, multi-stage|Noise burst / pad|Clear envelope|Energy Decay Curve|Curvature, multi-slope decay|
|**Modulation presence**|Motion, chorus, instability|Sustained sine / organ|Any movement is reverb-only|Spectrogram (steady-state)|Sidebands, wobble|
|**Modulation timing**|Early vs late motion|Sustained sine|Time separation|Time-sliced spectrogram|When modulation begins|
|**Spin / swirl**|Rotational motion in tail|Organ chord|Stable harmonic content|Phase / stereo correlation|Coherent rotation|
|**Modes / resonance**|Ringing tones, pitch focus|Muted pluck / sine burst|Excites modes cleanly|Waterfall / mode cloud|Modal persistence|
|**Physicality**|Object-like vs statistical space|Pluck + noise|Contrast structure vs wash|Mode cloud + correlation|Coupling / structure strength|
|**Scattering**|Loss of specular reflections|Clap / noise|Exposes early decorrelation|Early IR + correlation|Boundary interaction|
|**ER → late handoff**|When geometry disappears|Clap → noise|Time-based perception|Time-segmented IR|Transition point|
|**Stability**|Collapse, pumping, runaway modes|Sustained tone|Stresses feedback|Late IR + spectrogram|Instabilities|
|**Overall intent**|Room / plate / hall / bloom|Vocal + pad|Musical judgement|Compare all plots|Design priorities|

**How to use the table**

- Don’t try to cover all rows at once.
    
- Pick 3–5 rows per listening pass.
    
- Form a hypothesis (“this feels dispersion-heavy”).
    
- Confirm with the corresponding analysis.
